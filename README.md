# homebridge-icomfort

This is a plugin for [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) for the Lennox iComfort Thermostat implemented in Java Script.

The plugin works with the [iComfort Wi-Fi](https://www.lennox.com/products/comfort-controls/thermostats/icomfortwi-fi) (controllable online using [My iComfort](https://www.myicomfort.com/)). It probably will *not* work if you have the [iComfort S30/E30/M30](https://www.support.lennoxicomfort.com/help/compare/compare.html) models (controllable online using [Lennox iComfort](https://www.lennoxicomfort.com)).

Update 7/9/2020: Version 2.0.0
- Temperature rounding fixes, code cleanup and some other minor bug fixes.

Update 3/27/2018: Version 1.0.0
- Added support for zones. Added an optional zoneNumber parameter (defaults to 0 for single zone systems). For multi-zone systems just add another configuration with a unique name and zoneNumber.
- Deprecated Program Mode setting. Lennox changed their interface and it no longer works. Switching modes (OFF, COOL, HEAT, AUTO) will only work in manual mode and not in program / schedule  mode.
- Added Away custom characteristic to enable / disable Away mode. This characteristic is not available from the Apple Home.app. It is available in more functional HomeKit apps and can be added to an automation or scene which can be triggered by Siri or the Home.app.

# Installation

1. Install homebridge using: npm install -g homebridge
2. Install this plugin using: npm install -g homebridge-icomfort
3. Update your configuration file. See below for a sample. 

# Example Configuration

```json
  {
    "accessory": "iComfortThermostat",
    "name": "Thermostat",
    "username": "USERNAME",
    "password": "PASSWORD",
    "gatewaySN": "SERIAL_NUMBER",
    "zoneNumber": 0
  }
```

`"accessory": "iComfortThermostat"` allows homebridge to identify the correct plugin, and should not be changed. You can use an alternate name instead of “Thermostat” if you prefer. 

`USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` should be your My iComfort login information.

You can find the `SERIAL_NUMBER` by logging in to [My iComfort](https://www.myicomfort.com/), selecting the “System” tab, and looking for your Thermostat Serial Number (e.g., XY12Z34567).
